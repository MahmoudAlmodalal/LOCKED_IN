# Habit Streak Calculation - Implementation Guide

## Overview
Successfully implemented accurate streak calculations for habit tracking based on consecutive completed days.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Date Parsing Issue** âœ…
**Problem**: Backend was returning dates as ISO strings (`2025-10-11T00:00:00.000000Z`) but frontend was trying to parse them incorrectly, resulting in "Invalid Date".

**Solution**: Updated `useHabitEntries` hook to extract the date portion from ISO strings before parsing:
```typescript
const dateString = e.date.split('T')[0]; // Get YYYY-MM-DD from ISO string
const entryDate = new Date(`${dateString}T00:00:00`); // Parse as local midnight
```

### 2. **Current Streak Calculation** âœ…
**Implementation**: `getCurrentStreak(habit)` function

**Logic**:
1. Get all completed entries for the habit, sorted by date (newest first)
2. Check if the most recent entry is today or yesterday
   - If more than 1 day ago â†’ streak is 0 (broken)
3. Count consecutive days backwards from the most recent entry
4. Stop counting when there's a gap of more than 1 day

**Example**:
```
Today: Oct 11
Entries: Oct 11 âœ“, Oct 10 âœ“, Oct 9 âœ“, Oct 7 âœ“
Result: Current Streak = 3 days (Oct 11, 10, 9 - breaks at Oct 8)
```

### 3. **Best Streak Calculation** âœ…
**Implementation**: `getBestStreak(habit)` function

**Logic**:
1. Get all completed entries for the habit, sorted by date (oldest first)
2. Iterate through entries and count consecutive days
3. Track the maximum streak found
4. Reset counter when there's a gap

**Example**:
```
Entries: Oct 1 âœ“, Oct 2 âœ“, Oct 3 âœ“, Oct 5 âœ“, Oct 6 âœ“, Oct 7 âœ“, Oct 8 âœ“
Streaks: [3 days] (Oct 1-3), [4 days] (Oct 5-8)
Result: Best Streak = 4 days
```

## How It Works

### Current Streak Display
Shows the number of consecutive days the habit has been completed, counting backwards from today or yesterday:
- Must include today or yesterday to be active
- Resets to 0 if the last completion was more than 1 day ago
- Updates in real-time when you mark a habit complete

### Best Streak Display  
Shows the longest consecutive streak ever achieved for that habit:
- Scans all historical entries
- Finds the longest consecutive sequence
- Never decreases (unless entries are deleted)
- Displayed in both:
  - Individual habit cards (next to current streak)
  - Stats overview (maximum across all habits)

## User Experience

### When you mark a habit complete:
1. âœ… Entry is created/updated in the database
2. ðŸ”„ Entries are reloaded
3. ðŸ“Š Streaks are automatically recalculated
4. ðŸŽ¯ UI updates to show:
   - Updated current streak (may increase by 1)
   - Updated best streak (if current > best)
   - "Completed" status for that day

### Stats Overview:
- **Total Habits**: Count of all habits
- **Completed Today**: Habits marked complete for today
- **Best Streak**: Highest streak across ALL habits

## Code Locations

### Frontend
- **Streak Functions**: `/frontend/src/app/dashboard/habits/page.tsx`
  - `getCurrentStreak(habit)` - Line ~173
  - `getBestStreak(habit)` - Line ~204
  
- **Date Parsing**: `/frontend/src/lib/hooks.ts`
  - `useHabitEntries()` hook - Line ~435

### Display
- Individual habit cards: Shows both current and best streak
- Stats overview: Shows overall best streak

## Testing

To verify the streak calculations:

1. **Create a new habit**
2. **Mark it complete for today** â†’ Current: 1, Best: 1
3. **Mark it complete for yesterday** (change date picker) â†’ Current: 2, Best: 2
4. **Skip a day and mark complete** â†’ Current: 1, Best: 2
5. **Mark complete for 5 consecutive days** â†’ Current: 5, Best: 5

## Performance Notes

- Calculations run on every render but are efficient (O(n) where n = entries)
- Only processes entries for the specific habit being displayed
- Date comparisons use millisecond timestamps for accuracy

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Cache streak calculations in backend database
- Update streaks via a background job
- Add streak notifications/reminders
- Show streak history graph
- Add streak freeze/vacation mode
